TASK: Fix Facebook posting system for Gradus Media automation

BACKGROUND:
- Facebook credentials exist in Replit Secrets (FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID, FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN)
- Token is valid for 50+ more days
- Backend health check shows "social_poster": "awaiting credentials"
- Need Facebook posting working for presentation tomorrow

REQUIRED ACTIONS:

1. CHECK REPLIT SECRETS:
   - Verify FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID exists and has a value
   - Verify FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN exists and has a value
   - Show me the Page ID (redact token for security)

2. CHECK BACKEND CODE:
   - Examine backend/services/facebook_poster.py
   - Verify it's reading from environment variables correctly
   - Look for: os.getenv('FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID') and os.getenv('FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN')
   - Check if there are any import errors or configuration issues

3. FIX CREDENTIALS LOADING:
   - Ensure backend/main.py or backend/config.py loads Replit Secrets as environment variables
   - Add debug logging to show when credentials are loaded
   - Restart the backend to reload environment variables

4. REASSIGN CONTENT TO FACEBOOK:
   - Query database for approved articles with target_platform = ["linkedin"]
   - Change 3 of them to target_platform = ["facebook"]
   - Commit changes to database
   - Show me the article IDs that were reassigned

5. TEST FACEBOOK POSTING:
   - Use FacebookPoster class to post one article
   - Handle any errors gracefully
   - Show me the result (post URL or error message)

6. VERIFY SYSTEM STATUS:
   - Check /health endpoint shows "social_poster": "configured"
   - Verify at least 3 articles are queued for Facebook
   - Show me the current content queue status

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Facebook Page ID should be numeric
- Access token starts with "EAA" and is very long
- Local image paths are in: attached_assets/generated_images/
- Database is PostgreSQL, models are in backend/models.py
- Use absolute paths for file operations

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
✅ Credentials found and loaded
✅ Backend configured for Facebook posting
✅ 3 articles reassigned to Facebook platform
✅ 1 test post successful to Facebook
✅ System ready for automated posting at 6pm daily

If you encounter errors, explain them clearly and suggest fixes.
