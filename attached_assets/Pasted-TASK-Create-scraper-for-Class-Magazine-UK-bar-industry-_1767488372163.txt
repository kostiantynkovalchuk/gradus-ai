TASK: Create scraper for Class Magazine (UK bar industry source)
Context:
We're adding Class Magazine (https://www.classmagazine.com/) as a new content source for GradusMedia. This is a UK-based bar and cocktail industry publication that will diversify our content mix with European perspective and bar-specific focus, complementing our existing Modern Restaurant Management (restaurant-focused) content.
Requirements:
1. Create new scraper module:

File location: backend/scrapers/class_magazine.py
Follow the same pattern as existing scrapers (MRM, The Spirits Business, etc.)
Class name: ClassMagazineScraper

2. Scraping specifications:

Base URL: https://www.classmagazine.com/
Target: Recent articles from main news/articles section
Frequency: Should integrate with existing scraping schedule
Articles per run: 3-5 most recent articles

3. Content extraction:
Extract the following fields:

title - Article headline (Ukrainian translation will happen separately)
content - Full article body text
original_url - Link to original article
source - Always "Class Magazine"
published_date - Original publication date if available
category - Try to extract category/topic if available (e.g., "Cocktails", "Bar Design", "Industry News")

4. Content filtering:

Remove photo credits - Filter out lines like "Photo by...", "Image credit:", etc.
Skip lists/rankings - We want editorial articles, not "Top 10" lists
Minimum length - Articles should be at least 500 characters
English only - No need to handle other languages, we translate to Ukrainian

5. Integration with existing system:

Save to same articles table in PostgreSQL
Set initial status as 'pending' (for approval workflow)
Generate DALL-E image using existing image generation logic
Trigger translation to Ukrainian via existing Claude API integration
Should work with existing Telegram approval workflow

6. Error handling:

Handle connection timeouts gracefully
Skip articles that fail to parse (log error, continue)
Avoid duplicate articles (check by URL before inserting)
Rate limiting - respect website's robots.txt, add delays between requests

7. Testing:

Create test function to scrape 1-2 articles
Verify all fields are populated correctly
Check that content is clean (no photo credits, proper formatting)
Ensure it doesn't break existing scrapers

8. Configuration:
Add Class Magazine to scraper registry/config so it runs automatically with other sources.
Expected file structure:
backend/
  scrapers/
    class_magazine.py          # New scraper
    __init__.py                # Update to include new scraper
  scripts/
    test_class_scraper.py      # Optional: test script
Success criteria:

Scraper successfully extracts 3-5 recent articles from Class Magazine
Articles appear in database with status='pending'
Content is clean and properly formatted
Integrates seamlessly with existing translation and approval workflow
Can be run manually: python -m scrapers.class_magazine

Tech stack: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, BeautifulSoup4/requests for scraping
Important: Follow the exact same patterns and conventions as existing scrapers in the codebase. Don't reinvent the wheel - reuse existing helper functions for translation, image generation, and database insertion.
