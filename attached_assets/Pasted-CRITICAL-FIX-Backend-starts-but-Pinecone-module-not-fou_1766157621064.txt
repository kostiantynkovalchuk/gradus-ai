CRITICAL FIX: Backend starts but Pinecone module not found, causing RAG to fail.

DIAGNOSIS:
- Error: "Pinecone not installed: No module named 'pinecone'" at startup
- Port 8000 already in use from previous process
- packages installed with pip but not persisting/accessible
- chat_endpoints.py trying to import Pinecone but failing silently

ROOT CAUSE:
The import error is being caught somewhere, allowing the app to start but with RAG disabled.

REQUIRED FIXES:

1. Kill all running backend processes:
   Run: pkill -f "python backend/main.py"
   Run: pkill -f "uvicorn"

2. Verify backend/requirements.txt has these packages:
   - pinecone-client==3.0.0
   - langchain==0.1.0
   - langchain-community==0.0.10
   - openai (should already be there)
   - NO sentence-transformers line

3. Install packages using pip (not poetry, not conda):
   Run: pip install --upgrade pip
   Run: pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   Verify with: pip list | grep pinecone
   Should show: pinecone-client 3.0.0

4. Check backend/routes/chat_endpoints.py imports:
   At the top, verify these imports exist and are NOT in a try/except:
```python
   from pinecone import Pinecone, ServerlessSpec
```
   
   Remove any try/except around Pinecone imports that might be hiding errors.
   
   If there's a try/except like this:
```python
   try:
       from pinecone import Pinecone
   except:
       Pinecone = None
```
   REMOVE the try/except - let it fail loudly if import fails.

5. Verify backend/services/rag_utils.py has:
```python
   from openai import OpenAI
```
   NOT:
```python
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
```

6. After fixes, test:
   Run: python -c "from pinecone import Pinecone; print('✅ Pinecone imports!')"
   Should print: ✅ Pinecone imports!
   
   If this fails, the package isn't installed properly.

7. Start backend:
   Run: python backend/main.py
   
   Should see NO "Pinecone not installed" error
   Should see: "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000"

8. Test in another terminal:
   Run: curl http://localhost:8000/chat/health | python3 -m json.tool
   
   Should show:
   "pinecone_connected": true
   "rag_enabled": true

CRITICAL: If pinecone import fails, the app should FAIL TO START, not continue with RAG disabled. Remove any error catching around Pinecone imports.
