🤖 Replit Agent Prompt - Auto-Ingest HoReCa Sources:
Create a HoReCa knowledge ingestion system to expand Maya's expertise beyond alcohol.

TASK:
Build a script that ingests articles from leading HoReCa industry sources into Pinecone for Maya's RAG system.

CREATE FILE: backend/scripts/ingest_horeca_sources.py

REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Source Configuration:**
   Define top HoReCa sources with metadata:
   - Restaurant Business Online (US restaurant trends)
   - QSR Magazine (fast casual insights)
   - Hospitality Net (global hotel news)
   - The Caterer (European hospitality)
   - Hotel Management (hotel operations)
   
2. **Article Selection:**
   For each source, ingest 10-15 most recent/relevant articles about:
   - Restaurant operations & profitability
   - Hotel management & guest experience
   - Kitchen technology & equipment
   - Labor management & staffing
   - Menu trends & pricing strategies
   - Customer experience & service
   
3. **Smart Scraping:**
   - Use existing scraping functions from services/rag_utils.py
   - Handle different site structures gracefully
   - Extract: title, content, publish date, author
   - Skip paywalled content
   
4. **Rich Context Creation:**
   Each article should be embedded with context like:
SOURCE: Restaurant Business Online
CATEGORY: Restaurant Operations
REGION: Global (applicable to Ukraine)
RELEVANCE: Staffing strategies for post-pandemic recovery
TITLE: [article title]
CONTENT: [article content]
This is industry knowledge from a leading HoReCa publication,
providing insights for restaurant, hotel, and cafe operators.

5. **Metadata for Retrieval:**
```python
   metadata = {
       "source": "Restaurant Business Online",
       "source_url": "...",
       "category": "restaurant_operations",  # or hotel_management, kitchen_tech, etc.
       "region": "global",
       "content_type": "industry_article",
       "is_gradus_content": False,  # External source
       "industry_sector": "restaurant",  # or hotel, cafe, bar
       "published_date": "2024-12-20",
       "relevance": "high"  # for Ukrainian HoReCa
   }
```

6. **Execution:**
   - Process 10-15 articles per source
   - Total ~50-75 articles for initial knowledge base
   - Log progress and errors
   - Handle rate limiting (sleep between requests)
   
7. **Output:**
🌍 HoReCa Knowledge Ingestion
📰 Restaurant Business Online
✓ "5 Ways to Reduce Labor Costs" - ingested
✓ "Menu Pricing Strategies 2024" - ingested
[10 articles total]
🏨 Hospitality Net
✓ "Hotel Tech Trends" - ingested
[15 articles total]
📊 SUMMARY:
Total processed: 75
Successfully ingested: 72
Failed: 3
✅ Maya now has HoReCa industry knowledge!

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Reuse httpx and BeautifulSoup from existing scraper
- Reuse get_embedding() from rag_utils.py
- Upsert to same Pinecone index: "gradus-media"
- Use namespace: "company_knowledge"
- Each article = 1 vector
- Add error handling for 403/404/timeout
- Respect robots.txt

TESTING:
After ingestion, Maya should be able to answer:
- "Як знизити витрати на персонал у ресторані?"
- "Які тренди в готельному бізнесі 2024?"
- "Як покращити досвід гостя?"

The script should be reusable - we can run it monthly to refresh knowledge.
