Rebrand company name from AVTD to BestBrands throughout the entire system.

CONTEXT:
The company is rebranding from "AVTD" to "BestBrands". This is Ukraine's largest alcohol distributor with 40,000+ retail points. Update all references while maintaining the company's role and capabilities.

CHANGES NEEDED:

1. UPDATE backend/services/avatar_personalities.py

In BASE_GRADUS_IDENTITY, find and replace:
- OLD: "AVTD (also known as BestBrands)"
- NEW: "BestBrands"

- OLD: "AVTD is Ukraine's largest alcohol distributor"
- NEW: "BestBrands is Ukraine's largest alcohol distributor"

In MAYA_GRADUS_PERSONALITY:
- Replace all "AVTD" mentions with "BestBrands"
- Update example responses that mention AVTD

In ALEX_GRADUS_PERSONALITY:
- Replace all "AVTD" mentions with "BestBrands"
- Update cocktail examples if AVTD is mentioned

2. UPDATE backend/services/brand_enrichment.py (if exists)

Find any hardcoded AVTD references:
- Company name in enrichment text
- Brand portfolio descriptions
- Replace with "BestBrands"

3. SEARCH FOR AVTD MENTIONS

Search entire codebase for "AVTD" (case-insensitive):
```bash
grep -r -i "avtd" backend/ frontend/
```

Update any occurrences in:
- Comments
- Documentation strings
- Example queries
- Test data
- Log messages

4. UPDATE MEMORY/CONTEXT FILES (if any exist)

Check these directories:
- backend/data/
- backend/context/
- Any JSON/text files with company context

5. COMMIT CHANGES
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Rebrand from AVTD to BestBrands across entire system"
git push origin main
```

TESTING AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
After Render deploys, test Maya's responses:
- "Які бренди горілки є в BestBrands?"
- "Tell me about BestBrands"
- "What brands does AVTD have?" (should correct to BestBrands)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Keep all brand names unchanged (GREENDAY, HELSINKI, etc.)
- Keep Wikipedia vodka knowledge unchanged
- Only change company name AVTD → BestBrands
- Maintain all capabilities and knowledge

The rebrand should be seamless - Maya just now works for BestBrands instead of AVTD!
