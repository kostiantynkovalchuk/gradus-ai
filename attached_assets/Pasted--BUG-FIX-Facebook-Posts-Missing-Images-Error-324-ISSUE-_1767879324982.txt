🐛 BUG FIX: Facebook Posts Missing Images (Error 324)

## ISSUE SUMMARY
Facebook posts are succeeding but WITHOUT images due to expired DALL-E URLs.

Error logs show:
- "Missing or invalid image file" (Facebook error 324)
- System falls back to text-only posting
- Images exist in database and serve correctly via /api/images/serve/{id}

## DIAGNOSTIC STEP (DO THIS FIRST)

Before making any changes, analyze the current architecture:

1. Locate and read: backend/services/facebook_poster.py
   - Find the post_to_facebook() or post_with_image() method
   - Identify how it currently handles images
   - Show me the relevant code section

2. Verify image serving works:
   - Confirm /api/images/serve/{article_id} endpoint exists in main.py
   - Check if it returns images from database successfully
   - Look for logs showing "INFO:     ... - "GET /api/images/serve/{id}" 200 OK"

3. Confirm the issue:
   - Look for warnings about local image paths not found
   - Look for attempts to use DALL-E URLs
   - Confirm error 324 from Facebook API

After analysis, respond with:
✅ "Analysis complete. I found the issue in [file] at [line]. Current code tries to use [X] but should use [Y]."

## ROOT CAUSE
The facebook_poster.py currently tries to:
1. First: Use local file path (doesn't exist on Render - ephemeral filesystem)
2. Fallback: Use DALL-E URL (expires after ~1 hour)

But it should:
3. Use the public /api/images/serve/{article_id} endpoint (always works, serves from database)

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

Update facebook_poster.py to use the database-backed image serving endpoint:
```python
# In post_to_facebook() method, replace image URL logic with:

# Build public URL to database image endpoint
backend_url = os.getenv("BACKEND_URL", "https://gradusmedia-backend.onrender.com")
image_url = f"{backend_url}/api/images/serve/{article.id}"

logger.info(f"Using database image via: {image_url}")

# Post to Facebook /photos endpoint with this URL
response = requests.post(
    f"https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/{self.page_id}/photos",
    data={
        "url": image_url,  # Facebook fetches from our backend
        "message": post_message,
        "access_token": self.access_token
    }
)
```

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

1. **Backup first**: Show me the current post_to_facebook() method before changes

2. **Update facebook_poster.py**:
   - Remove logic that tries local file paths
   - Remove logic that uses DALL-E URLs
   - Add logic to use /api/images/serve/{article_id}
   - Keep the text-only fallback as safety net

3. **Add environment variable check**:
   - Ensure BACKEND_URL is read from environment
   - Add fallback default if not set
   - Log the constructed image URL for debugging

4. **Preserve existing functionality**:
   - Keep text-only fallback if image URL fails
   - Keep all logging statements
   - Don't change the /photos endpoint or message format
   - Don't change approval workflow or notification system

## SAFETY CHECKS

Before confirming the fix:
- ✅ Verify /api/images/serve/ endpoint exists and works
- ✅ Confirm article.id is available in the posting method
- ✅ Ensure BACKEND_URL environment variable is set (or has default)
- ✅ Keep text-only fallback in case of errors
- ✅ Test that the constructed URL format is correct

## VERIFICATION

After implementation:
1. Show me the updated code
2. Confirm no other endpoints were affected
3. List any new environment variables needed
4. Explain how to test the fix

## IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

❌ DO NOT:
- Change the /api/images/serve/ endpoint itself
- Modify database schema or image storage
- Change approval workflow or Telegram notifications
- Remove the text-only fallback mechanism
- Touch any other services or endpoints

✅ ONLY:
- Modify facebook_poster.py image URL construction
- Update how images are passed to Facebook API
- Improve logging for debugging

Please analyze the current code first, confirm you understand the issue, then implement the fix safely.
