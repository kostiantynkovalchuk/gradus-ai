TASK: Execute complete end-to-end workflow for Facebook content automation with REAL Telegram approval

GOAL: Full system test from scraping to Facebook posting - user will approve articles via Telegram buttons

WORKFLOW STEPS:

=== STEP 1: SCRAPE FACEBOOK SOURCES ===
- Import ScraperManager from backend/services/scrapers/scraper_manager
- Scrape from these 3 sources:
  * just_drinks (English, needs translation)
  * delo_ua (Ukrainian, no translation)
  * horeca_ukraina (Ukrainian, no translation)
- Limit: 2 articles per source (total 6 articles)
- Save to ContentQueue with:
  * target_platform = ["facebook"]
  * status = "scraped"
  * language = "en" or "uk"
  * needs_translation = True/False
- Show me the article IDs and titles created

=== STEP 2: TRANSLATE ENGLISH ARTICLES ===
- Import TranslationService from backend/services/translation_service
- Find articles with needs_translation = True AND status = "scraped"
- Translate to Ukrainian using Claude API
- Update articles with:
  * translated_title
  * translated_text
  * status = "translated"
- Show me translation results (original vs translated titles)

=== STEP 3: GENERATE IMAGES & SEND TO TELEGRAM ===
- Import ImageGenerator from backend/services/image_generator
- For each translated/Ukrainian article:
  * Generate DALL-E image based on translated title + content
  * Save image to attached_assets/generated_images/
  * Update article with:
    - image_url (DALL-E URL)
    - local_image_path (saved file path)
    - status = "pending_approval"
  * IMMEDIATELY send Telegram notification with:
    - Image (from local_image_path)
    - Translated title
    - Translated content (first 200 chars)
    - Inline buttons: ✅ Approve | ❌ Reject
  * Store telegram_message_id in article metadata
- Show me confirmation of Telegram messages sent with article IDs

=== STEP 4: WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL ===
- PAUSE HERE
- User will check Telegram and click ✅ Approve buttons
- Show me the current article statuses
- Explain: "Now check your Telegram and approve the articles you like. When ready, I'll proceed to posting."

=== STEP 5: POST APPROVED ARTICLES TO FACEBOOK ===
(Wait for user confirmation before executing this step)
- Import FacebookPoster from backend/services/facebook_poster
- Find articles with status = "approved" AND target_platform contains "facebook"
- For each approved article:
  * Post to Facebook with image and translated content
  * Update article with:
    - status = "posted"
    - posted_at = current timestamp
    - facebook_post_url in extra_metadata
- Show me the Facebook post URLs

=== VERIFICATION ===
After posting, show me:
1. Total articles scraped: X
2. Total articles translated: X
3. Total images generated: X
4. Total Telegram notifications sent: X
5. Total articles approved by user: X
6. Total articles posted to Facebook: X
7. Facebook post URLs for verification

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- DO NOT simulate approval - wait for real Telegram button clicks
- After Step 3, STOP and wait for user to approve in Telegram
- Only execute Step 5 after user confirms approvals are done
- Handle errors gracefully and show detailed error messages
- Use absolute file paths for images
- Verify Facebook credentials are loaded before posting
