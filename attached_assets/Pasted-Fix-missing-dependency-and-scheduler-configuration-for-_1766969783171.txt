Fix missing dependency and scheduler configuration for Modern Restaurant Management scraper.

ISSUE:
Deployment failed with error: "No module named 'feedparser'"
Modern Restaurant Management scraper was created but not added to scheduler configuration.

TASKS:

1. **Add feedparser to dependencies:**
   - Add "feedparser" to backend/requirements.txt
   - This is required for RSS feed parsing

2. **Update scheduler to include Modern Restaurant Management:**
   
   Edit backend/services/scheduler.py:
   
   Find line ~120 in scrape_facebook_sources_task() function:
```python
   facebook_sources = ['delo_ua', 'restorator_ua', 'just_drinks']
```
   
   Change to:
```python
   facebook_sources = ['delo_ua', 'restorator_ua', 'just_drinks', 'modern_restaurant_management']
```
   
   Find line ~200 in check_and_run_missed_scraping() function:
```python
   facebook_sources = ['Delo.ua', 'HoReCa-Україна', 'Just Drinks']
```
   
   Change to:
```python
   facebook_sources = ['Delo.ua', 'HoReCa-Україна', 'Just Drinks', 'Modern Restaurant Management']
```
   
   Find line ~500 in start() function (scheduler startup log):
```python
   INFO:services.scheduler:   Facebook (Daily):
   INFO:services.scheduler:      • Delo.ua 🇺🇦
   INFO:services.scheduler:      • HoReCa-Україна 🇺🇦
   INFO:services.scheduler:      • Just Drinks 🇬🇧
```
   
   Add after Just Drinks:
```python
   INFO:services.scheduler:      • Modern Restaurant Management 🍽️
```

3. **Verify the scraper file exists:**
   - Confirm backend/services/scrapers/modern_restaurant_management.py is present
   - Confirm it's imported in backend/services/scrapers/manager.py
   - Confirm it's imported in backend/services/scrapers/__init__.py

EXPECTED RESULT:
After fix, scheduler should show:
- ✅ feedparser installed
- ✅ LinkedIn scraper runs without errors
- ✅ Facebook scraper includes Modern Restaurant Management
- ✅ Startup log shows "Modern Restaurant Management 🍽️" in sources list

After making changes, commit with message:
"fix: Add feedparser dependency and integrate Modern Restaurant Management into scheduler"

Then push to trigger Render deployment.
