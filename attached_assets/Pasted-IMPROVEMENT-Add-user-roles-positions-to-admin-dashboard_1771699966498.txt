IMPROVEMENT: Add user roles/positions to admin dashboard analytics.

STEP 1 - CHECK EXISTING DATA:
Run this query first and report results:

  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 'maya_users'
  ORDER BY ordinal_position;

  -- Then check what position values actually exist:
  SELECT position, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM maya_users
  WHERE position IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY position
  ORDER BY count DESC;

STEP 2 - IF position COLUMN EXISTS:
Add role breakdown to GET /api/admin/analytics/overview:

  roles_breakdown: [
    { role: 'owner', count: int },
    { role: 'bartender', count: int },
    { role: 'manager', count: int },
    -- etc, all distinct values ordered by count DESC
  ]

Also add to GET /api/admin/users response:
  Include position field in every user row.
  Add position as a column in the users table in the dashboard.
  Add position filter dropdown alongside the existing tier filter.

STEP 3 - IF position COLUMN IS NULL OR MISSING:
Add the column:
  ALTER TABLE maya_users 
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS position VARCHAR(100);

Then update the registration endpoint (POST /api/maya/register)
to accept and save position from the request body.
The frontend already collects it during signup — just needs saving.

STEP 4 - ADD ROLES CHART TO ANALYTICS TAB:
In the /admin dashboard HTML, add a new card/chart after the 
tier breakdown showing role distribution as a horizontal bar chart:

  "Ролі користувачів"
  Owner      ████████ 24
  Bartender  ██████ 18  
  Manager    ████ 12
  Other      ██ 6

Use Chart.js horizontal bar (indexAxis: 'y').

STEP 5 - CROSS-SEGMENT ROLES WITH TIERS:
Add a small breakdown showing role vs tier conversion:

  SELECT position, subscription_tier, COUNT(*)
  FROM maya_users
  GROUP BY position, subscription_tier
  ORDER BY position, subscription_tier;

Surface this in the dashboard as a table:
  Role | Free | Standard | Premium | Total
  Owner | 12 | 8 | 4 | 24
  Bartender | 16 | 2 | 0 | 18

This shows which roles convert to paid — critical for targeting.

STEP 6 - VERIFY:
1. /api/admin/analytics/overview includes roles_breakdown array
2. /admin Analytics tab shows role distribution chart
3. /admin Users tab has Position column and filter dropdown
4. Role × Tier conversion table visible in Analytics tab
