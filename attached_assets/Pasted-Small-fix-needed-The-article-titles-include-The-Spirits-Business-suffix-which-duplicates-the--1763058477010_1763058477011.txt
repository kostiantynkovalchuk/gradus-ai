Small fix needed: The article titles include " - The Spirits Business" suffix, which duplicates the source information shown separately.

Please update the scraper to clean article titles:

UPDATE backend/services/news_scraper.py:

Add a title cleaning method:
```python
def clean_article_title(self, title: str, source_name: str = "The Spirits Business") -> str:
    """
    Clean article title by removing source suffix
    
    Args:
        title: Raw article title
        source_name: Source publication name to remove
        
    Returns:
        Clean title without source suffix
    """
    if not title:
        return ""
    
    # Remove source name from end of title
    # Patterns: " - The Spirits Business", " | The Spirits Business", etc.
    patterns = [
        f' - {source_name}',
        f' | {source_name}',
        f' – {source_name}',  # em dash
        f' — {source_name}',  # longer dash
    ]
    
    cleaned_title = title
    for pattern in patterns:
        if cleaned_title.endswith(pattern):
            cleaned_title = cleaned_title[:-len(pattern)].strip()
            break
    
    return cleaned_title
```

UPDATE scrape_spirits_business() to use title cleaning:
```python
def scrape_spirits_business(self, limit: int = 5) -> List[Dict]:
    """Scrape with clean titles"""
    articles = []
    
    try:
        # ... existing code ...
        
        for article in article_elements:
            # ... extract title, url, etc. ...
            
            # Clean title (remove source suffix)
            clean_title = self.clean_article_title(title, "The Spirits Business")
            
            if clean_title and url:
                # ... rest of the code ...
                
                articles.append({
                    'title': clean_title,  # Use cleaned title!
                    'url': url,
                    'content': clean_content,
                    # ... rest ...
                })
        
        return articles
```

This will ensure titles are clean and source is only shown once in the "Source:" field.

Please implement this quick fix!
