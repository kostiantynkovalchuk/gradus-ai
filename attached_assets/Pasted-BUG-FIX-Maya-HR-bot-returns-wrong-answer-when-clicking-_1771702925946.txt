BUG FIX: Maya HR bot returns wrong answer when clicking suggested question buttons.

SYMPTOM:
- Asking "Як замовити стілець?" → correct answer about furniture ordering ✅
- Clicking the suggested button "Як замовити основні фонди (меб..." → returns 
  conflict resolution answer instead ❌

ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION:

STEP 1 - CHECK BUTTON CALLBACK DATA:
Find where suggested question buttons are created in:
  backend/services/hr_keyboards.py (or similar)
  backend/services/hr_rag_service.py

Look for where "related questions" or "sources" buttons are built.
Check: what is stored as callback_data for these buttons?
Is it the full question text or the truncated display label?

Telegram buttons have two fields:
  text = what user sees (can be truncated)
  callback_data = what gets sent to bot (max 64 bytes)

If callback_data is being set to the truncated text, that's the bug.

STEP 2 - CHECK CALLBACK HANDLER:
Find the callback query handler that processes button clicks.
When a user clicks a suggested question button, what happens?
Does it:
  A) Send the callback_data as a new message → goes through full RAG pipeline
  B) Look up callback_data in a mapping table → retrieves stored answer
  C) Something else?

STEP 3 - FIX OPTIONS:

Option A (if callback_data is truncated):
  Store full question text as callback_data.
  Telegram callback_data limit is 64 bytes.
  If question exceeds 64 bytes, store a question_id instead:
  
    callback_data = f"q:{question_id}"
    
  Then in the callback handler, look up the full question text by ID
  from hr_content or hr_preset_answers table before processing.

Option B (if callback_data is correct but matching fails):
  In the callback handler, when processing a suggested question click,
  bypass fuzzy matching entirely and do a direct lookup:
  
    # For button clicks, use exact content_id lookup if available
    # rather than sending through the full RAG pipeline
    if callback_data.startswith("q:"):
        content_id = callback_data[2:]
        answer = get_answer_by_content_id(content_id)
    else:
        answer = rag_pipeline(callback_data)

STEP 4 - CHECK SPECIFIC CASE:
Find the preset or content item for "Як замовити основні фонди (меблі/обладнання)?"
What is its content_id or preset_id?
Verify it exists and has correct answer content.

Also check: why is the conflict resolution preset matching?
What keyword in "основні фонди" could trigger conflict resolution?
Look at conflict preset patterns - is there an overlap?

STEP 5 - FIX AND TEST:
After fix, test these scenarios:
1. Type "Як замовити основні фонди?" → should get furniture/equipment answer
2. Click the suggested button → should get same correct answer
3. Type "Як замовити стілець?" then click "Як замовити основні фонди" button
   → both should return correct distinct answers
