I need to create a proper database initialization and migration system for my Gradus AI project to prevent schema mismatch issues when deploying to new environments.

CONTEXT:
- FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL database
- Currently deployed on Render.com
- Just experienced a schema mismatch where the `image_data BYTEA` column was missing after migration
- Database tracks content queue, approval logs, and scraping state

CURRENT DATABASE SCHEMA (from production):
Table: content_queue
- id (PRIMARY KEY)
- source_name
- source_url
- title
- content
- original_language
- scraped_at
- translated_title
- translated_content
- translated_at
- image_url
- image_data (BYTEA) - for persistent image storage
- image_generated_at
- telegram_sent_at
- approved
- approved_at
- posted_linkedin
- posted_facebook
- rejected
- rejected_at

Table: scrape_log (for tracking last scrape times)
- source_name (PRIMARY KEY)
- last_scraped_at

WHAT I NEED:

1. **Database initialization script** (`init_db.py`):
   - Connect using DATABASE_URL environment variable
   - Create all tables with complete schema if they don't exist
   - Add any missing columns to existing tables
   - Should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
   - Include indexes for performance (on scraped_at, approved, posted_*, etc.)

2. **Schema documentation** (`docs/database_schema.md`):
   - Complete table definitions
   - Column descriptions and purposes
   - Relationships and constraints
   - Migration history

3. **Migration setup** (optional but recommended):
   - Set up Alembic for future schema changes
   - Create initial migration from current schema
   - Instructions for creating new migrations

4. **Deployment checklist** (`docs/deployment_checklist.md`):
   - Steps to set up database on new environment
   - Environment variables needed
   - How to verify schema is correct

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use psycopg2 for database connection
- Handle connection failures gracefully
- Log what changes are being made
- Should work with both local and production databases
- Include instructions for running the script on Render.com

DELIVERABLES:
1. `backend/init_db.py` - Main initialization script
2. `docs/database_schema.md` - Complete schema documentation
3. `docs/deployment_checklist.md` - Deployment instructions
4. Updated README with database setup instructions
5. (Optional) Alembic setup for migrations

Please create these files and show me how to run the initialization script both locally and on Render.com.
