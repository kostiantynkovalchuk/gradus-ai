Add a comprehensive Article Manager to the existing GradusMedia dashboard with deletion capabilities.

CONTEXT:
- Dashboard URL: https://gradus-ai.onrender.com/
- FastAPI backend with React/TypeScript frontend
- PostgreSQL database on Neon
- Dashboard is in English
- Need web UI for managing articles (view, search, delete)

REQUIREMENTS:

## 1. BACKEND API ENDPOINTS (FastAPI)

Add to `backend/main.py` or create `backend/routes/articles.py`:

### Endpoints needed:
```python
GET /api/admin/articles
  - Query params: limit, offset, search, status, date_from, date_to
  - Returns: list of articles with metadata
  - Include: article details + platform counts (facebook_posts, telegram_posts)

GET /api/admin/articles/{article_id}
  - Returns: full article details + all related platform posts
  - Include: facebook post IDs, telegram message IDs

DELETE /api/admin/articles/{article_id}
  - Deletes article + all related posts from all platforms
  - Returns: deletion summary (what was deleted)

POST /api/admin/articles/bulk-delete
  - Body: {"article_ids": [1, 2, 3]}
  - Deletes multiple articles
  - Returns: success/failure for each

POST /api/admin/articles/delete-by-date
  - Body: {"date_from": "2025-01-01", "date_to": "2025-01-07"}
  - Deletes articles in date range
  - Returns: count deleted

GET /api/admin/articles/export
  - Query params: same as GET articles
  - Returns: CSV/JSON export
```

### Features:
- Proper error handling with detailed messages
- Transaction support (rollback on failure)
- Deletion logging to database table or file
- Authentication middleware (check if admin user)
- CORS configuration for frontend

## 2. FRONTEND DASHBOARD UI

Create new component: `frontend/src/components/ArticleManager.tsx`

### UI Requirements:

**Layout:**
- Header: "Article Manager" with stats (total articles, published, pending)
- Filters bar: Search input, date range picker, status dropdown
- Article table with columns:
  - ID
  - Title (clickable to view details)
  - Category
  - Published Date
  - Platforms (icons: 🌐 Website | 📱 Facebook | ✈️ Telegram)
  - Actions (View | Delete buttons)

**Features:**
1. **Article List View:**
   - Sortable columns
   - Pagination (20 per page)
   - Real-time search
   - Multi-select checkboxes for bulk actions
   - Loading states and error handling

2. **Article Details Modal:**
   - Full article info
   - List of all platform posts (with IDs and links)
   - Preview thumbnail if image exists
   - Delete button

3. **Delete Confirmation:**
   - Modal with warning
   - Show what will be deleted:
     * Article ID and title
     * Number of Facebook posts
     * Number of Telegram posts
   - Require typing "DELETE" to confirm
   - Red danger button

4. **Bulk Actions:**
   - Checkbox to select multiple articles
   - "Delete Selected" button
   - Confirmation modal with list of articles

5. **Date Range Deletion:**
   - Collapsible "Advanced" section
   - Date pickers (from/to)
   - Preview count before deleting
   - Confirmation required

6. **Export Function:**
   - "Export" button
   - Downloads CSV with current filter/search results

**Styling:**
- Use existing dashboard design system
- Consistent with other dashboard pages
- Responsive (mobile-friendly)
- Loading spinners for async actions
- Success/error toast notifications

## 3. DATABASE & SAFETY

**Add deletion log table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS deletion_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    article_id INTEGER,
    article_title TEXT,
    deleted_by TEXT,
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    platforms_affected JSONB
);
```

**Transaction handling:**
- Wrap all deletions in transactions
- Rollback if any platform deletion fails
- Log successful deletions

## 4. NAVIGATION

Add to dashboard sidebar:
- Icon: 🗑️ or 📝
- Label: "Article Manager"
- Route: `/admin/articles` or `/dashboard/articles`
- Highlight when active

## 5. AUTHENTICATION

- Check user role/permissions before allowing deletions
- Show error if unauthorized
- Log which user performed deletion

## 6. ERROR HANDLING

Frontend:
- Network errors
- API errors (400, 404, 500)
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Graceful degradation

Backend:
- Database connection errors
- Foreign key constraint errors
- Transaction rollback errors
- Detailed error messages in logs

## 7. TESTING CONSIDERATIONS

Add comments for:
- Which endpoints need authentication
- Expected error scenarios
- How to handle concurrent deletions
- Rate limiting if needed

EXISTING CODE TO PRESERVE:
- Current dashboard layout and navigation
- Authentication system
- Database connection setup
- Existing article display/approval workflows

OUTPUT:
1. Complete backend routes file
2. Complete frontend component
3. Update to navigation/routing
4. Database migration if needed
5. Brief setup instructions

Make it production-ready, user-friendly, and consistent with existing dashboard design.
