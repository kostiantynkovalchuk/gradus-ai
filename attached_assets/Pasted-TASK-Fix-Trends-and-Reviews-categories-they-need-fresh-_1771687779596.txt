TASK: Fix Trends and Reviews categories - they need fresh articles with Unsplash images

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- News category shows fresh articles with Unsplash photos ✅
- Trends and Reviews are stuck with old articles with DALL-E images (no image_photographer) ❌
- Not enough new articles are being categorized as 'trends' or 'reviews'

STEP 1 - DATABASE AUDIT:
Run this SQL to understand the current state:

  -- Articles per category with Unsplash vs DALL-E images
  SELECT 
    category,
    status,
    COUNT(*) as total,
    SUM(CASE WHEN image_photographer IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as unsplash,
    SUM(CASE WHEN image_url IS NOT NULL AND image_photographer IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as dalle,
    SUM(CASE WHEN image_url IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as no_image
  FROM content_queue
  GROUP BY category, status
  ORDER BY category, status;

Report the full results.

STEP 2 - FIX DALL-E IMAGES IN TRENDS/REVIEWS:
Update the migrate-dalle-to-unsplash endpoint (or scheduler logic) to include
ALL statuses including 'published'. Articles in trends/reviews with DALL-E images
must get Unsplash replacements regardless of whether they've been posted to Facebook.

After fixing, run the migration for ALL categories (not just news/draft):
  UPDATE content_queue SET image_photographer = NULL 
  WHERE image_url IS NOT NULL AND image_photographer IS NULL;
  -- (just audit first, don't delete - replace via Unsplash service)

STEP 3 - FIX CATEGORIZATION BIAS:
Open backend/services/categorization.py and check the current keyword scoring.

The problem: most scraped articles contain generic news keywords so everything
defaults to 'news'. We need smarter categorization.

Update the categorize_article function with expanded Ukrainian + English keywords:

  trend_keywords = [
    '2025', '2026', '2027', 'forecast', 'trend', 'future', 'prediction',
    'outlook', 'next year', 'emerging', 'growing', 'rise of', 'shift',
    'consumer behavior', 'market shift', 'industry direction',
    'тренд', 'прогноз', 'майбутнє', 'зростання', 'перспектив'
  ]
  
  review_keywords = [
    'review', 'tasting', 'award', 'rating', 'flavor', 'taste', 'recommend',
    'best', 'top', 'ranked', 'score', 'notes', 'palate', 'finish', 'aroma',
    'distillery visit', 'bottle', 'expression', 'edition', 'release',
    'огляд', 'дегустація', 'нагорода', 'рейтинг', 'смак', 'аромат', 'рекомендуємо'
  ]

Also lower the threshold for category assignment from score >= 2 to score >= 1,
so that a single strong keyword match wins instead of defaulting to 'news'.

STEP 4 - RECATEGORIZE EXISTING ARTICLES:
After updating the categorization logic, recategorize articles that are currently
marked as 'news' but may actually be trends or reviews.

Write a script that:
1. Fetches all articles with category = 'news' (status: approved OR published)
2. Runs categorize_article() on each one with the NEW improved logic
3. Updates category if result is 'trends' or 'reviews' (don't override correct news articles)
4. Logs how many changed per new category

This should populate Trends and Reviews with properly categorized content.

STEP 5 - VERIFY FRONTEND API:
Confirm that GET /api/articles?category=trends and GET /api/articles?category=reviews
return different articles than GET /api/articles?category=news.
Test each endpoint and report the count returned per category.

Report at the end:
- Articles per category after recategorization
- How many DALL-E images were replaced in trends/reviews  
- Sample of 3 article titles that moved to trends, 3 to reviews
