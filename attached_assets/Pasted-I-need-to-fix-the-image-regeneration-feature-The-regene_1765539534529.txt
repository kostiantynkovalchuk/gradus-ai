I need to fix the image regeneration feature. The regeneration is generating new images successfully, but they're not showing up in the UI after page reload.

PROBLEM ANALYSIS FROM LOGS:
- The /api/images/regenerate/{article_id} endpoint successfully generates new DALL-E images
- New images are saved to disk at /app/backend/attached_assets/generated_images/
- However, the /api/images/serve/{article_id} endpoint serves images from the database image_data field
- The regenerate endpoint is NOT updating the image_data field in the database
- Result: UI still shows old image because database wasn't updated

FIX REQUIRED:

1. Update the /api/images/regenerate/{article_id} endpoint to:
   a) After generating and saving the new image to disk, READ the saved image file back into memory
   b) Update the article.image_data field with the new image bytes
   c) Update article.updated_at timestamp
   d) Commit changes to database
   e) Add cache-busting timestamp to the response URL

2. Update the /api/images/serve/{article_id} endpoint to:
   a) Accept an optional query parameter 'v' (for cache busting)
   b) Ignore the 'v' parameter (it's only for browser cache busting)

EXPECTED CODE CHANGES:

In the regenerate endpoint, after generating the image:
```python
# After image generation (which saves to disk)
# Read the saved image file back
local_file_path = # path to the saved dalle_*.png file
with open(local_file_path, 'rb') as f:
    image_bytes = f.read()

# Update database
article.image_data = image_bytes
article.updated_at = datetime.now()
db.commit()

# Return with cache-busting URL
import time
timestamp = int(time.time())
return {
    "status": "success", 
    "image_url": f"/api/images/serve/{article_id}?v={timestamp}",
    "message": "Image regenerated successfully"
}
```

In the serve endpoint signature:
```python
@app.get("/api/images/serve/{article_id}")
async def serve_image(article_id: int, v: int = None, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # v parameter ignored, just for cache busting
    # ... rest of existing code unchanged
```
