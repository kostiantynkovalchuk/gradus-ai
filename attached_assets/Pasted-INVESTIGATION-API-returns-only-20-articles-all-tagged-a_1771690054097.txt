INVESTIGATION: API returns only 20 articles all tagged as "news" despite DB 
recategorization completing successfully on 128 articles.

STEP 1 - FIND ALL ARTICLE-RELATED TABLES:
Run this SQL to see every table in the database:

  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  ORDER BY table_name;

Then check article counts in ALL relevant tables:

  SELECT 'content_queue' as tbl, category, COUNT(*) 
  FROM content_queue GROUP BY category
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'articles' as tbl, category, COUNT(*) 
  FROM articles GROUP BY category;

(adjust table names based on what actually exists)

STEP 2 - FIND WHICH TABLE THE API READS FROM:
Open backend/routes/articles.py (or wherever GET /api/articles is defined).
What table/model does it query? ContentQueue or Article or something else?

STEP 3 - ROOT CAUSE FIX:
Likely scenario A - Two separate tables:
  The recategorization updated content_queue but the API reads from a 
  separate 'articles' table that is populated differently (e.g. only when 
  articles are posted to Facebook). 
  Fix: run the same categorization update on whichever table the API reads from.

Likely scenario B - Single table, API ignores category filter:
  Check the API route - if it has a hardcoded LIMIT 20 applied BEFORE 
  the category filter, it will return 20 random articles then filter to 3.
  Fix: apply category filter FIRST in the WHERE clause, then apply LIMIT.

  Correct query order:
    SELECT * FROM content_queue 
    WHERE status = 'published' AND category = :category  ← filter first
    ORDER BY published_at DESC 
    LIMIT 20                                              ← limit after

STEP 4 - APPLY CATEGORY UPDATE TO CORRECT TABLE:
Once you identify the table the API reads from, run:

  SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM [correct_table] GROUP BY category;

If all show 'news' or NULL, run the categorization update on that table
using the same logic applied to content_queue.

STEP 5 - VERIFY:
After fix, confirm:
  GET /api/articles?category=news    → ~20 news articles with Unsplash images
  GET /api/articles?category=trends  → ~20 trends articles with Unsplash images  
  GET /api/articles?category=reviews → available reviews articles (up to 20)

The 20-article display limit per category page is acceptable and expected.
Just ensure the LIMIT applies after category filtering, not before.
