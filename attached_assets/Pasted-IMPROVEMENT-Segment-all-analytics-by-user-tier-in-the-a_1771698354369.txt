IMPROVEMENT: Segment all analytics by user tier in the admin dashboard.

The maya_query_log table already has a user_tier field ('free', 'standard', 'premium').
Update the analytics to split metrics by tier everywhere.

STEP 1 - UPDATE /api/admin/analytics/overview:

Add tier breakdown to every metric:

{
  total_questions: int,
  questions_by_tier: {
    free: int,
    standard: int, 
    premium: int
  },
  questions_today_by_tier: {
    free: int,
    standard: int,
    premium: int
  },
  preset_hit_rate_by_tier: {
    free: float,   -- free users likely hit same presets repeatedly
    standard: float,
    premium: float
  },
  avg_response_time_by_tier: {
    free: float,
    standard: float,
    premium: float
  },
  top_questions_by_tier: {
    free: [{text, count}],      -- top 10 per tier
    standard: [{text, count}],
    premium: [{text, count}]
  },
  questions_per_day: [{date, free, standard, premium}]
  -- stacked by tier for the line chart
}

STEP 2 - UPDATE ANALYTICS TAB in /admin dashboard HTML:

Summary cards row: add tier badge breakdown under total questions.
Example card:
  "Всього питань: 1,247"
  Free: 891 | Standard: 312 | Premium: 44

Preset hit rate card: show per-tier rate, not just overall.

Top questions chart: add tier filter dropdown (All / Free / Standard / Premium)
  Switching filter re-renders the bar chart for selected tier only.

Daily questions line chart: make it stacked by tier (3 colored lines):
  Free = gray, Standard = orange, Premium = gold
  This visually shows if paid usage is growing vs free.

STEP 3 - UPDATE PRESET CANDIDATES logic:

In the daily aggregation task (scheduler.py), when creating candidates
also store which tier the questions came from most:

ALTER TABLE alex_preset_candidates 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS dominant_tier VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'free';

This shows whether a candidate question is driven by free users 
(low priority to presetify) or paid users (high priority — they 
need better/faster answers).

Show dominant_tier as a badge in the Preset Candidates tab.
Paid-user-driven candidates should be visually highlighted 
(orange border or "💎 Paid" badge) since those are highest priority.

STEP 4 - VERIFY:
1. Hit /api/admin/analytics/overview and confirm response has 
   questions_by_tier breakdown
2. Open /admin → Analytics tab → confirm tier breakdown visible on cards
3. Confirm line chart shows 3 separate colored lines
4. Confirm top questions dropdown filter works
