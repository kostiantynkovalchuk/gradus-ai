REPLIT AGENT TASK: Add Kill Switch for Automated Posting
Objective
Add an environment variable kill switch to pause automated Facebook and LinkedIn posting without stopping content scraping, translation, or Telegram approval workflows.
Implementation Required
1. Modify Facebook Posting Task
In backend/services/scheduler.py, find the post_to_facebook_task() function and add this check at the very beginning (after the function definition, before any other code):
pythonasync def post_to_facebook_task():
    # Kill switch for automated posting
    if os.getenv("DISABLE_AUTO_POSTING", "false").lower() == "true":
        logger.info("🛑 Auto-posting to Facebook disabled via DISABLE_AUTO_POSTING environment variable")
        return
    
    # ... rest of existing function code
2. Modify LinkedIn Posting Task
In the same file, find the post_to_linkedin_task() function and add the same check:
pythonasync def post_to_linkedin_task():
    # Kill switch for automated posting
    if os.getenv("DISABLE_AUTO_POSTING", "false").lower() == "true":
        logger.info("🛑 Auto-posting to LinkedIn disabled via DISABLE_AUTO_POSTING environment variable")
        return
    
    # ... rest of existing function code
3. Ensure os module is imported
At the top of backend/services/scheduler.py, verify this import exists:
pythonimport os
If it's not there, add it.
Requirements

Use .lower() == "true" for case-insensitive comparison
Default to "false" if variable is not set (so posting continues by default)
Add clear log messages with 🛑 emoji so we can see in logs when kill switch is active
Don't modify any other logic in the posting functions
Don't touch scraping, translation, or Telegram approval code

Testing
After making changes:

Show me the modified sections of code
Confirm the logic: when DISABLE_AUTO_POSTING=true, posting stops but everything else continues

Expected Behavior
When DISABLE_AUTO_POSTING is not set or = "false":

Posting runs normally at scheduled times (18:00 for Facebook, 18:30 for LinkedIn)

When DISABLE_AUTO_POSTING = "true":

Scheduler jobs still trigger at 18:00/18:30
Functions immediately return with log message
No articles are posted
Articles stay in queue with status='approved'
Scraping, translation, and Telegram approval continue normally

Additional Context
This kill switch is needed for Facebook reach recovery. We want to pause automated posting for 3-4 days while keeping the content pipeline running. The user will set this variable in Render's environment settings.
Start by showing me the current post_to_facebook_task() and post_to_linkedin_task() function signatures so I can verify the changes.
