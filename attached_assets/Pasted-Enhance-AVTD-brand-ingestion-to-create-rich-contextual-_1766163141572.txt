Enhance AVTD brand ingestion to create rich contextual knowledge for better RAG retrieval.

CURRENT ISSUE:
- AVTD ingestion gets repetitive menu text: "GREENDAY, HELSINKI, ADJARI та інші"
- Scores low (0.45-0.5) because no context about what these brands ARE
- Need: "GREENDAY is a premium vodka brand from AVTD..." format
- Target: 0.7+ retrieval scores

SOLUTION:
Update backend/services/rag_utils.py to add smart brand extraction and context enrichment.

ADD NEW FUNCTION after is_ingestion_request():
```python
def extract_brands_from_content(content: str, company_name: str) -> list:
    """
    Extract brand names and create rich contextual descriptions.
    
    Returns list of dicts: [{"name": "GREENDAY", "context": "GREENDAY is a premium vodka..."}]

UPDATE ingest_website() FUNCTION:

After loading documents (WebBaseLoader or Playwright), add enrichment:
```python
async def ingest_website(url: str, company_name: str, index, embedder=None) -> dict:
    try:
        # ... existing loading code ...
        
        # After getting documents, BEFORE chunking:
        if documents and len(documents) > 0:
            print(f"Enriching content with brand context...")
            documents = enrich_company_content(documents, company_name, url)
            print(f"✅ Created {len(documents)} enriched documents")
        
        # ... rest of function (chunking, embeddings, upload) ...
```

BENEFITS:
1. Creates brand-specific chunks: "GREENDAY is a premium vodka brand from AVTD..."
2. Adds company context: "AVTD distributes to 40,000+ locations"
3. Includes category info: vodka, cognac, wine, soju
4. Better semantic matching → higher scores (target 0.7+)

TEST:
1. Delete existing AVTD vectors from Pinecone (to start fresh)
2. Re-ingest: curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Вивчи https://avtd.com"}'
3. Test retrieval: curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Розкажи про GREENDAY vodka", "avatar": "maya"}'
4. Check scores with debug script - should now be 0.7+

Deploy after successful tests.
