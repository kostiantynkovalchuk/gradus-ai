# Check User Identity for telegram_id=296249724

## OBJECTIVE
Query the database to identify who telegram_id=296249724 is and compare with telegram_id=441389791 (known to be Konstantin Kovalchuk).

## TASK

Connect to the PostgreSQL database and run this query:
```sql
SELECT 
    telegram_id,
    full_name,
    phone,
    position,
    department,
    access_level,
    verification_method,
    is_active,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM hr_users
WHERE telegram_id IN (296249724, 441389791)
ORDER BY telegram_id;
```

## CONTEXT

Logs show telegram_id=296249724 is associated with "Konstantin Kovalchuk" but the user (actual Konstantin) didn't send that message. We need to determine:

1. Is this a different person with the same name?
2. What phone number is associated with this account?
3. When was this account created?
4. What verification method was used?

## DATABASE CONNECTION

The database connection string is in the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`.

Use Python with psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy to connect and execute the query.

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

Return the results in a clear table format showing:
- Both telegram IDs side by side
- Their full names
- Phone numbers (will reveal if they're different people)
- Positions
- When accounts were created

## IMPLEMENTATION
```python
import os
import psycopg2
from tabulate import tabulate

# Get database URL from environment
database_url = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")

# Connect and query
conn = psycopg2.connect(database_url)
cursor = conn.cursor()

query = """
SELECT 
    telegram_id,
    full_name,
    phone,
    position,
    department,
    access_level,
    verification_method,
    is_active,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM hr_users
WHERE telegram_id IN (296249724, 441389791)
ORDER BY telegram_id;
"""

cursor.execute(query)
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Get column names
columns = [desc[0] for desc in cursor.description]

# Print results
print(tabulate(results, headers=columns, tablefmt='grid'))

cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

✅ Query executes successfully
✅ Returns 2 rows (both telegram IDs)
✅ Shows clear differences in phone numbers or names
✅ Reveals when each account was created
